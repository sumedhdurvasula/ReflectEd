# Inspiration

ReflectEd was inspired by the desire to revolutionize the way students approach learning. Recognizing the challenges of retaining information from lengthy lectures, I aimed to create a solution that condenses educational content, enhances comprehension, and encourages active engagement. My passion for empowering students to excel in their academic pursuits, coupled with the belief that reflection, revision, and engagement are crucial for long-term learning retention, drives us to continually innovate and redefine the learning experience.

# What it does
ReflectEd is a comprehensive educational platform that transforms lengthy lectures into interactive and engaging learning experiences. By leveraging AI-driven speech-to-text transcription, customized GPT-3.5 LLM integration, and advanced visualization tools, ReflectEd generates concise summaries, key points, quizzes, study guides, and immersive gaming elements. Through fostering reflection, encouraging revision, and promoting active engagement, ReflectEd facilitates efficient comprehension, retention, and application of academic concepts, thereby significantly increasing the amount of learning retained by students.

# How it was built
ReflectEd was built using a powerful tech stack, combining the versatility of Next.js 13 for seamless web application development, Framer Motion for dynamic visual effects, and the flexibility of Tailwind CSS for efficient styling. Leveraging the robust capabilities of the MongoDB platform ensures reliable data management, while integration with the Google Cloud Platform guarantees seamless scalability to accommodate high traffic demands. The development process involved meticulous customization and integration of the GPT-3.5 LLM, ensuring accurate content generation and interactive learning experiences for users.
